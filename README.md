#### **Ex1 Code Documentation**
#### **Introduction**
This project contains a set of utility functions designed to manipulate and process numbers represented in various bases (binary, decimal, hexadecimal, etc.) as strings. It includes functionality for converting between representations, validating input, and comparing numbers across different bases.

The code also includes comprehensive tests using JUnit to ensure correctness and handle edge cases.

#### **Features**
- **Base Conversion:**

    - Convert numbers between different bases (e.g., binary to decimal, hexadecimal to decimal).
    - Support for bases ranging from 2 to 16.

- **Validation:**

    Check if a string is a valid representation of a number in a given base.

- **Comparison:**

    Determine if two numbers, represented in different bases, are equal.

- **Array Operations:**

    Find the index of the largest number in an array of base-represented strings.
